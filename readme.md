## General information:
The app allows you to search for any recipe and gives you the best results from the web, plus you can calculate the quantity of ingredients required based on the number of servings. Additionally, you have the option of bookmarking your favourite recipes. The user will then have the opportunity to add the necessary ingredients to his or her shopping cart.

App was created as part of [Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn).

## Concept:
We commonly face issues with the quantity of ingredients used when learning to make any new dish. The app provides the accurate amount of ingredients required to prepare the dish according to the number of servings. 

In the event that you wish to purchase the ingredients to make the dish, you will be aware of the exact amount you must purchase. However, if you already have some of the ingredients, you may adjust the quantity accordingly. By doing this, you can save time and money by purchasing only the amount of ingredients that you require. Therefore, you do not need to purchase additional ingredients.
